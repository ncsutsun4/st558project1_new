# **JSON data description**
  
  **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight and flexible data format that is easy for humans to read and for machines to parse. JSON has become a common format used in: 
  
  * Public APIs (e.g., Twitter)
  * NoSQL databases as a document format (e.g., MongoDB)
  * Relational databases as a new column type (e.g., PostgreSQL)
  
  JSON format is text only and independent to any programming language, so it is a good way to store data. 
  
  [Wikipedia introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and [JSON syntax introduction](http://json.org/).
  
# **Ways to read JSON data into R**

  There three major R packages available for reading JSON data into R (rjson, RJSONIO and jsonlite). Examples to compare behavior and performance of those three packages are [here](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/31702_9c22e3d1a0c44968a4a1f9656f1800ab.html). I prefer jsonlite because it provides more options for manipulating the format and most importantly we can get well formatted data by default.
  
# **Access NHL records 'Franchise' API and pulldown JSON data**

Function used to pull down "Francise" records.

```{r retrieve_info_function}
get_franchise <- function(endpoint,team_ID=NULL){
  base <- "https://records.nhl.com/site/api/"                 # API base
  
    if (!(endpoint %in% c("franchise","franchise-team-totals","franchise-season-records",
                          "franchise-goalie-records","franchise-skater-records"))) 
      stop("URL is not correct!")
  
    if (is.null(team_ID)) get_URL <- paste0(base, endpoint)
      else if (!(team_ID %in% c(1:38))) stop("Team ID is not correct!")
        else get_URL <- paste0(base, endpoint, "?cayenneExp=franchiseId=", team_ID) 

  get_request <- GET(get_URL)                                 # Get raw data
  get_request_text <- content(get_request, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8") # Get contents
  get_request_json <- fromJSON(get_request_text, flatten=TRUE)# Parse to list
  get_request_tbl <- as_tibble(get_request_json$data)         # Convert to tibble
  return(get_request_tbl)                                     # Return a table
}
```

Pull down data.

```{r retrieve_tables}
franchise <- get_franchise("franchise")
team_totals <- get_franchise("franchise-team-totals")
season_records <- get_franchise("franchise-season-records", 1)
goalie_records <- get_franchise("franchise-goalie-records", 1)
skater_records <- get_franchise("franchise-skater-records", 1)
```

# **Exploratory data analysis**

```{r}
team_info <- franchise %>% filter(is.na(lastSeasonId)) %>% 
                           select(id, firstSeasonId, teamCommonName, teamPlaceName) 
datatable(team_info, 
          rownames=NULL, 
          colnames=c("Franchise ID","First Season","Team Name","Team City"),
          caption = "Current NHL teams")
```

# **The team with highest winning ratio in NHL history**

All records of number of games a team played and wined was retrieved and ploted as below. all the teams seems have very similar winning ratios, except team "Montréal Canadiens"(#1) showed extraordinary winning rate in both regular season and playoffs. Interestingly, team "Edmonton Oilers"(#25) has much better performance in playoffs than in the regular seasons.

```{r}
if (!is.factor(team_totals$gameTypeId)) {
  team_totals$gameTypeId <- factor(team_totals$gameTypeId, 
                                 levels = c(2, 3), 
                                 labels = c("Regular Season", "Playoffs"))
}

team_totals %>% ggplot(aes(x=gamesPlayed, y = wins)) + 
                geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 2, position = "jitter") + 
                geom_smooth(method = lm, col="Red") +
                facet_wrap(~ gameTypeId, scale="free") +
                geom_text(aes(label=franchiseId), position="jitter",size = 4)
```

We can also see this from below two tables. Montréal Canadiens has the highest wining ratio among teams who played more than 2500 games. Again, Edmonton Oilers's wining ratio is much higher in playoffs than in regular seasons.

```{r, table}
regular_season <- team_totals %>% mutate(ratio = round(wins/gamesPlayed,2)) %>% filter(gameTypeId=="Regular Season") %>% arrange(desc(ratio)) %>% select(teamName,franchiseId, gamesPlayed, wins,ratio)

playoffs <- team_totals %>% mutate(ratio = round(wins/gamesPlayed,2)) %>% filter(gameTypeId=="Playoffs") %>% arrange(desc(ratio)) %>% select(teamName, franchiseId, gamesPlayed, wins, ratio)

datatable(regular_season, caption="Winning rato in regular seasons", rownames=NULL, colnames = c("Franchise ID", "Team Name", "Number of games played", "Number of games wined"))

datatable(playoffs, caption="Winning rato in regular seasons",rownames=NULL, colnames = c("Franchise ID", "Team Name", "Number of games played", "Number of games wined"))
```


# **Further check Montreal Canadiens team's plalyers in each position**
## The former and active players in each position.
Seems that Montreal Canadiens need more player on the right wing position.

```{r}
tbl <-table(skater_records$activePlayer, skater_records$positionCode)
rownames(tbl) <- c("Former player", "Current player")
colnames(tbl) <- c("Center", "Defence", "Left Wing", "Right Wing")

knitr::kable(tbl)
```

## Who is the active player got highest average scores/season in the team.
Tomas Tatar is the player in the team who got the highest average scores/season. Max Pacioretty is definitely the super star in the team who performed so well in the past 10 seasons.

```{r}
skater_records %>% filter(activePlayer == TRUE) %>% 
                   mutate(AvergePoints = round(points/seasons,2)) %>% 
                   arrange(desc(AvergePoints)) %>% 
                   unite(Name, firstName, lastName, sep=" ")%>%
                   select(Name, seasons, points, AvergePoints)
                
```
